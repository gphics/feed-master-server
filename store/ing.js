      `Barley is an annual, erect and tufted grass, up to 50 to 120 cm high. It has a strong fibrous root system, with seminal roots that grow as deep as 1.8-2.1 m and anchor the plant, and adventitious roots that explore the upper soil for moisture and nutrients (Ecocrop, 2011; UC SAREP, 2006). The stems are made of 5 to 7 hollow, cylindrical internodes. The leaves are linear and lanceolate, up to 25 cm long, placed opposite their neighbours along the stem (Ecocrop, 2011; Duke, 1983). In barley, the sheaths, ligule and auricles of the leaves surround the stem (Ecocrop, 2011). Spikes are variable in size (short or long) and shape (lax or compact). They may also be awned or awnletted or awnless; they are borne at the end of the culms. Depending on barley type, 1 or 3 spikelets are alternately borne at each node along the rachis of the spike. In domesticated barley, all spikelets are fertile: depending on the number of spikelets, there are barleys with 2 or 6 rows of grains (Cecarelli et al., 2006). Barley grain is an ellipsoid, grooved, 0.7-0.9 cm long caryopse that may be white, blue or black in colour and hairy at the end (Ecocrop, 2011; Duke, 1983).`,
      `There are thousands of cultivated barley landraces and hundreds of cultivars. Cultivars can be classified according to several factors: the number of rows of grains (2-row and 6-row), compactness of spikes, hull adherence (hulled or naked barley), presence or size of awns (awned, awnletted or awnless varieties), growth habit (winter or spring barley) and colour (white, blue or black kernels) (Cecarelli et al., 2006; CFIA, 2005; OECD, 2004). End-use may also be a way to classify barley (OECD, 2004). The average yield for barley grain is 2.7 t/ha but there are large differences between countries, from yields as high as 8.39 t/ha in Belgium to yields as low as 0.6 t/ha in Morocco and 0.2 t/ha in Lesotho (FAO, 2011).`,

      `Barley grain is an important feed ingredient for the major livestock species, and often competes with wheat and maize grain. For instance, barley is a valuable grain for finishing beef cattle in the United States (OECD, 2004). In most European countries, wheat and barley are the most commonly used cereal grains in poultry and pig feeds (Bergh et al., 1999).`,
      `Like maize and wheat, barley grain contains a high level of starch, about 60% DM (55-63%), which is lower than that of the other two cereal grains. Its protein content (about 11-12% with values comprised between 9.5 and 13% DM) is similar to that of wheat and higher than that of maize. Barley has a higher fibre content (crude fibre 4-6%, ADF 5-7%, NDF 18-24%) than maize and wheat, which results in a poorer nutritive value in animal species sensitive to fibre content (Feedipedia, 2011).`,
      `Several types of barley varieties can be of interest in animal feeding. Hulless varieties, which contain about half the fibre content of hulled varieties and 1-2% more protein, are more digestible and less bulky (CDC, 2003). Low-phytate barleys can help reduce phosphorus excretion (Gaylord et al., 2010). There are waxy barleys that contain more amylopectin (up to 97% of starch) than regular barleys (about 54%), and high-amylose barleys. The physical structure of starch (distribution of starch granules according to size) can interact negatively with the presence of other constituents (lipids, protein, ß-glucans) to decrease digestibility by reducing contact between the starch and the digestive enzymes (Svihus et al., 2005; Bergh et al., 1999). Waxy barleys are high in ß-glucans and should be treated with enzymes in pigs and avoided in poultry (CDC, 2003).

      `Brewers grains are the solid residue left after the processing of germinated and dried cereal grains (malt) for the production of beer and other malt products (malt extracts and malt vinegar). Though barley is the main grain used for brewing, beers are also made from wheat, maize, rice, sorghum and millet. In the brewing process, grains are soaked in water until they germinate and then dried to produce the malt (malting). The malted grains are milled and steeped in hot water so that enzymes transform the starch into sugars (mashing/saccharification). The resulting sugar-rich liquid (wort) is then boiled, filtered and fermented to produce beer (see Figure). Brewers grains are collected at the end of the mashing process, once all sugars have been removed from the grain. The remaining product is a concentrate of proteins and fibre that is suitable for animal feeding, particularly for ruminants (Crawshaw, 2004). Brewers grains are a highly variable by-product whose composition and nutritional value depend on the grain used, on the industrial process (temperature, fermentation, etc.) and on the method of preservation. Brewers grains are sold wet or dried, and can be ensiled (Blezinger, 2003).`,

      `Buckwheat is an erect annual herb that grows up to 1.2 m high and has an indeterminate growth habit. The root system consists in a shallow taproot and spreading secondary roots that can go 1 m deep (Kammermeyer, 2016). The stems are hollow and triangular. Its leaves are alternate, simple and entire, with stipules. Lower leaves are petiolated while upper ones are almost sessile. The leaf blade is triangular to cordate, 2-10 cm long x 2-10 cm broad. The inflorescence is an axillary or terminal cluster of flowers, combined in false racemes. The flowers are regular, small-sized, rose-red to white in colour. The fruit is a typical triangular, winged nutlet, 5-7.5 mm x 3 mm, grey-brown, dark brown to black in colour. The seed is pale green turning reddish brown almost the same size as the fruit (Jansen, 2006).`,
      `Buckwheat is primarily grown for human consumption. The grain is generally used as human food and as animal or poultry feed (Campbell, 1997). The grain is eaten whole or dehulled, cooked into porridge, ground into flour or groats depending on the intended use. The flour is used in the preparation of pancakes, biscuits, noodles ("crozets" in the French Alps), cereals, etc. Buckwheat has regained interest because of its protein is is gluten-free and thus sought after by consumers with gluten intolerance. It is reported to have prophylactic values, such as an anthelminthic effect when fed to livestock (Goncalves et al., 2016; Christa et al., 2008).`,
      `Buckwheat bran and middlings can be used to feed livestock. Buckwheat hulls have many uses. Farmers use them as fuel or to feed ruminants when the stock of buckwheat straw is exhausted.

Other uses include the production of potash and as a source of natural colors in the food industry (Ratan et al., 2011; Zemnukhova et al., 2004; Taranenko et al., 2016).`,

However, while observations about fagopyrism go back to the early 18th century, there are actually few reported cases, which are old and partly anecdotal, so that a scientific update should be necessary to define dietary thresholds (Leiber, 2016",

      `Corn gluten feed is a major feed ingredient in ruminant diets, particularly for beef and dairy cattle. Wet corn gluten feed contains 40 to 60% DM (Stock et al., 1999) while the dry product contains about 88% DM. Corn gluten feed is a moderately high source of protein: it contains about 20-25% DM of protein, more than cereal grains and milling by-products but less than corn gluten meal, distillers' grains and most oil meals. Corn gluten feed is much richer in cell wall constituents than maize grain (crude fibre 6-10% DM, NDF 31-49% DM, ADF 8-13% DM and a low lignin content about 1.2% DM) which tends to limit its use in pig and poultry diets. The crude fat content is usually under 4% DM. Corn gluten feed contains relatively high and quite variable amounts of residual starch, from 11% to more than 30% DM. Ash content is also important (about 7% DM).

`,
      `The composition of corn gluten feed is influenced by the proportion of steep liquor, which contains more energy and protein than the bran (Scott et al., 1997). The ratio of steep liquor to bran is generally 1:3 to 2:3 and differences in nutritive value between products containing low or high levels of steep liquor can be important (Schroeder, 2010; Stock et al., 1999). Corn gluten feed varies in color from yellow-light brown to dark brown, depending on the amount of steep liquor, drying temperature and drying time. Dried corn gluten feed generally darkens with increased drying temperature or time. Extremely dark corn gluten feed with a "burned" smell may be heat damaged and the protein digestibility may be reduced (Schroeder, 2010; Myer et al., 2011).

      `Corn gluten feed is the by-product of the wet-milling of maize grain for starch (or ethanol) production (Hoffman et al., 2010). Corn gluten feed consists mainly of maize bran and maize steep liquor (liquid separated after steeping) but may also contain distillers solubles, germ meal, cracked maize screenings, as well as minor quantities of end-products from other microbial fermentations (Stock et al., 1999). The chemical composition of corn gluten feed varies hugely, as it depends on the milling process and on the relative proportions of bran, steep liquor and other components. Particularly, the energy and protein content of corn gluten feed are positively correlated to the proportion of steep liquor in the blend (Stock et al., 1999).`,
      `The wet-milling process of maize is described in the figure above. The process yields 5 main products: maize starch, maize germ oil meal, corn gluten meal, corn gluten feed and maize steep liquor. After cleaning and removal of foreign material, the maize grain is usually steeped in water with sulfur dioxide (SO2) for 24-40 hours at a temperature of 48-52°C. The role of sulfur dioxide is to weaken the glutelin matrix by breaking inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds. Steeping at 45-55°C favours the development of lactic acid bacteria that produce lactic acid, lowering the pH of the medium and thereby restricting growth of most other organisms. At the end of steeping phase, the maize kernels contain about about 45% water, have released about 6.0-6.5% of their dry substance as solubles into the steepwater and have become sufficiently soft to be pulled apart easily with the fingers (BeMiller et al., 2009). After steeping, the maize kernels are coarsely ground so that the germs are separated from the endosperm and used for oil extraction which yields maize germ oil meal. The remaining steeping water is condensed into a steep liquor. The endosperm undergoes further screenings that separate the fibre from gluten (protein fraction) and starch slurry. Fibre (bran) can be mixed with steep liquor and maize germ oil meal to create corn gluten feed (ISI, 2008; RFA, 2011). The fibre-free endosperm is centrifugated in order to separate the starch fraction and the gluten, which have different densities, resulting in almost pure starch (99% starch), and corn gluten meal (CRA, 2006).`,
      `Corn gluten feed is a feed ingredient mostly used in cattle diets as a source of energy and protein. Its economic value depends upon the relative price of whole grain and protein feeds. In the United States, it is usually considered as a source of protein (Ash, 1992). However, in the late 1980s, corn gluten feed was one of the several duty-free Non Grain Feed Ingredients that the European feed industry imported massively from the USA as a source of energy, to substitute for EU cereal grains that were very expensive at the time. Corn gluten feed imports declined after the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms reduced EU grain prices (Ash, 1992; Hasha, 2002).`,

In agriculture, they are used for fuel, litter for poultry and other animals, mulch and soil conditioner, and as fodder for ruminants despite their low nutritive value (Evers et al., 1994; Jansen, 2012). Their absorbency and abrasiveness makes them useful for several industrial applications. They can absorb finishing fluids, oil and water in industrial applications, and also help to clean up industrial or environmental spills. They are excellent carriers for vitamins and antibiotics in animal feed, and for herbicides and pesticides in lawn care products. They are used for the production of chemicals such as furfural or the sugar replacement xylitol. Maize cobs are used to blast and polish many materials, from jewellery, nuts and bolts, to golf club heads. More recently, maize cobs were reported to be a potential cheap and promising source for sustainable energy production (Evers et al., 1994; Jansen, 2012; Göhl, 1982).`,

Some varieties have been created to improve the industrial or nutritional value: high lysine, high tryptophan, high oil, high amylose, low phytate, etc. Brown midrib maize has a lower lignin content resulting in an increased digestibility in livestock. Genetically-modified (GM) maize varieties have been designed to improve grain performances (herbicide resistance, pest resistance, higher yields).`,

Sorghum grain is a small, hard caryopsis covered by glumes. In grain sorghum, panicles are compact and bear 25,000 to 60,000 seeds/kg. Forage sorghum yields 120,000-160,000 seeds/kg. The whole grain can be boiled, roasted, popped or ground to make flour for baking (flat breads) and pastry. Sorghum grain is used for the production of alcoholic beverages, including beer and liquors. Some sorghum varieties are used for dyeing textiles or leathers (Ecoport, 2009).`,

      `Wheat bran, a by-product of the dry milling of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) into flour, is one of the major agro-industrial by-products used in animal feeding. It consists of the outer layers (cuticle, pericarp and seedcoat) combined with small amounts of starchy endosperm of the wheat kernel. Other wheat processing industries that include a bran removal step may also produce wheat bran as a separate by-product: pasta and semolina production from durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), starch production and ethanol production.`,
      `It is important to note that wheat bran is not a product with a universally accepted definition and clear boundaries. Though national regulations may contain mandatory requirements on bran composition, ingredients sold under that name encompass a wide range of wheat by-products. Milling yields variable proportions of flour, depending on the quality of the final product. The extraction rate (flour:grain ratio) goes from 100% for a wholemeal flour to less than 70% for pastry flour. Typical extraction rates range from 75% to 80%, resulting in 20 to 25% wheat offals (Kent et al., 1994). Wheat bran represents roughly 50% of wheat offals and about 10 to 19% of the kernel, depending on the variety and milling process (Ash, 1992; WMC, 2008; Prikhodko et al., 2009; Hassan et al., 2008). In the industrial milling process, after a cleaning step that removes grain impurities, the grains are tempered (soaked to toughen the outer layers and mellow the starchy endosperm in order to facilitate their separation) and then subjected to a series of grinding operations that produce finer and finer flour particles. The first grinding steps yield coarse particles of broken wheat and bran, and the later steps produce other by-products (WMC, 2008). Milling by-products are traditionally named after their quality (fineness, colour, etc.) and/or the stage of the process at which they arose, with considerable variations between languages, countries, regions, milling processes and even mills. In industrial countries, these products used to be sold separately (coarse bran, fine bran, middlings, second clear, thirds, etc.) but are now mixed together in variable proportions (MacDonald et al., 2002).`,
      `Consequently, wheat milling offals form a continuum of products with a decreasing fibre:starch ratio, from the fibrous coarse brans produced by the first grinding steps to starchy feed-grade flours. Wheat brans sold for animal feeding are typically mixtures of true coarse brans and finer products from the later grinding stages. In rural and traditional milling, flour is directly separated from bran in a one-step milling and screening. This type of bran has a higher starch content and a higher nutritive value (Piccioni, 1965). In Ethiopia, farmers prefer high-density bran since weight indicates that the bran contains more flour and thus higher energy (Gebremedhin et al., 2009). The situation is made even more complex by the existence of wheat brans from other wheat species (durum) and wheat processing industries.`,
      `Wheat bran is suitable for livestock feeding and very palatable to most classes of animals (Fuller, 2004; Piccioni, 1965). Wheat bran is a bulky feed that can be used to lighten dense, heavy feed mixtures. It can be readily incorporated into mashes. Good bran should have a fair coating of flour and be in the form of large, dry and non-adherent flakes. It is sold raw or pelleted (Göhl, 1982).`,

Its oil content (3-5% DM) is higher than that of the whole grain. The fibre and starch contents are inversely correlated and extremely variable, as they depend on the relative amounts of envelopes, endosperm and other fractions mixed together. However, a product marketed as bran should contain relatively high amounts of fibre: crude fibre 7-14 DM, NDF 35-54% DM, ADF 9-16% DM and low amounts of ADL 2-4% DM. Wheat bran should also contain about 15-30% DM of starch (Feedipedia, 2011). Fibre is the main constraint for the utilization of wheat bran in animal nutrition, particularly in monogastrics.

      `Wheat grain (Triticum spp.) is a major staple food that provides about 20% of food energy and protein worldwide. Wheat is also an excellent energy source for farm animals: in 2007, 102 million tons (16.7% of worldwide production) were used to feed animals. This proportion is higher in industrialised countries: in the EU-27 in 2007, 42% of wheat production was used as feed (FAO, 2011). Feed wheat is often surplus to human requirements or low-quality wheat unsuitable for human consumption (low test weight or damaged wheat), but wheat is also grown specifically for feed purposes (Blair, 2008; Lalman et al., 2011). The inclusion of wheat grain in feeds depends on the relative market prices of the major feed grains. When maize, barley and sorghum are expensive, or when wheat prices are depressed, wheat becomes a valuable option (Lalman et al., 2011). In some countries, the use of home-grown feeds has gained interest because of their lower cost and wheat grain has been increasingly used in livestock rations (Blair, 2011). The wheat variety available for animal feeding depends on the region: hard red spring or winter wheats are generally used in North America while soft wheats are more common in Europe.`,
      `Due to very early selection of specific traits for bread or pastry making, wheat grains are highly variable in colour, form and starch types. Bread wheat grains are generally vitreous, whereas soft wheat grains are more opaque (van Ginkel et al., 1996). Wheat grain is basically a source of energy in the form of carbohydrates (starch) enclosed in outer layers that form the bran. Unlike barley or oats, wheat grain is easily dehulled by threshing. Wheat grain is highly palatable and is a digestible source of nutrients for all classes of farm animals. However, like other carbohydrate-rich feeds, it must be fed with caution to ruminants and horses as it may cause digestive upsets (Blair, 2011; GNIS, 2011).`,
      `Wheat grain can be fed whole or processed in many different ways. It can be fed in association with other ingredients, or mixed and processed into pellets in concentrate feeds (GNIS, 2011; Feillet, 2004). Wheat grain unsuitable for food processing (due to disease, insects, frost, sprouting, low test weight, etc.) can be fed to farm animals. The feeding value and palatability of such grain may be similar or lower than that of good quality wheat, depending on the extent of the damage. It may be necessary to mix it with another cereal grain and to screen it for mycotoxin contamination (Bell, 2003).`,

      "Wheat is primarily a source of energy due to its high starch content (about 70% DM). It is richer in protein than maize and barley (11-13% DM for soft wheats vs. 8-10% for maize and 11-12% for barley) and can thus be used as a replacement for maize as a high-energy ingredient requiring less protein supplementation than maize. Hard wheats and durum wheats have a much higher protein content (more than 14-15% DM for durum wheats) than soft wheats. Due to the natural separation of husk from the grain during threshing, the fibre content of wheat is very low (crude fibre less than 3%), slightly higher than that of maize, but half that of barley and much lower than that of oats (Feedipedia, 2013).",
      `The chemical composition of wheat can be highly variable, particularly with regard to starch and crude protein content, depending on species, cultivars, growing location, climate, soil fertility, etc. (Zijlstra et al., 1999; Zijlstra et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2005). For instance, wheat containing up to 23% DM as protein and 80% DM as starch has been reported in the literature, as well as wheat containing as little as 9% protein and 50% starch (Kim et al., 2005). Such variability means that periodic testing of batches of wheat is highly recommended (Blair, 2011). Wheat protein is relatively poor in lysine (2.9% of crude protein) but due to its higher protein content wheat contains much more lysine and more tryptophan than maize (Kim et al., 2005). Wheat grains with low test weights have a lower starch content but are slightly richer in protein and fibre (Lalman et al., 2011). `,
      `A benefit of wheat as a feed ingredient is that the presence of viscous gluten improves pellet quality, reducing the need for a pellet binder. This effect becomes noticeable when wheat is included at 10% or more in the pellet (Blair, 2008; Bell, 2003).`,

Wheat grain can cause acute acidosis if fed in large quantities to unaccustomed ruminants. The fermentation of large amounts of starch in the rumen lowers rumen pH, resulting in rumen stasis, a decrease in forage digestion, diarrhoea, dehydration and metabolic acidosis. If acidosis reaches the blood, it can cause heart failure, kidney failure and death. Acute acidosis occurs in ruminants that accidentally consume large amounts of cereal grains. When animals are progressively introduced to wheat grain in combination with hay, no particular problems occur even at high inclusion levels (Walker, 2006).

Bacterial development, although low, should be avoided given the low levels of moisture and the absence of carbohydrates. Cooking fish meal above 80°C normally destroys bacteria but the whole chain-process is susceptible to re-infection: high air-temperature must be reached in the dryers, external sources of contamination (rodents, birds, flies and insects) must be eliminated, and storage buildings must be dry (no condensation) and clean (FAO, 1986).
        Fish meal is also susceptible to chemical contamination with harmful substances (chlorinated hydrocarbons: dieldrin, lindane, PCBs, dioxins) (Erne et al., 1979), due to the accumulation of those anthropogenic substances in the marine food chain and finally in the fatty tissues of fish used for the manufacture of fish meal. The levels of such contaminants (PCBs, dioxins) in fish meal depend on the fish source: fish meals from Central America have lower levels than those from the Northern hemisphere (New et al., 2002).
        A toxic substance called gizzerosine is formed when fish meal is directly dried at 180°C (vs. 140°C) in order to improve fish meal productivity. Gizzerosine is detrimental to poultry as it causes gizzard erosion and black vomit (Hinrichsen et al., 1997). This problem can be avoided if steam is used to dry fish meal (Sugahara, 1995).

      `Feather meal results from the processing of the feathers obtained after poultry slaughtering. Feather meal is used as a source of protein for farm animals and as a fertilizer. Feathers are a byproduct of broiler, turkey and and other poultry processing operations. Feathers represent 3-7% weight of the live bird, therefore producing a considerable mass of protein (Soni et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2014).`,
      `Feather meal is a protein source of poor quality because its protein is deficient in amino acids that essential in many livestock species, notably lysine, methionine, histidine and tryptophan (Crawshaw, 2019; Baker et al., 1981). Another issue is that keratin, the main component (80-100%) of feather proteins, is poorly digestible when raw (Moran et al., 1967). This highly polymerized protein contains about 8% cysteine, a sulphur amino acid that makes strong disulphur bonds between each other within the primary structure and contributes to the folding of the chain into secondary structures (alpha-helix and beta-sheet in a ratio of 2:1). While this makes raw feathers light, durable, and unable to stretch (unlike hair), it also makes feather keratin undigestible (digestibility < 5%) (Papadopoulos, 1985; Kornillowicz-Kowalska et al., 2011).`,
      `For that reason, it is necessary to hydrolyze feather meal in order to transform it into a valuable source of protein in animal feeding (El Boushy et al., 1990 ; Papadopoulos, 1985). A thorough hydrolysis under controlled conditions (see processes below) destroys disulphur bonds between amino acids and convert feathers into hydrolized feathers. Hydrolized feathers are then dried to 8% moisture and ground to produce a valuable uniform hydrolized feather meal. All feather meals produced within the EU are reported to be hydrolized (Crawshaw, 2019). Variability of feather meal between batches and between plants can be quite high due to differences in processes.`,

World poultry production, including chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese and guinea fowl was 55.5 billion head in 2009 (FAO, 2011). It can be estimated from this figure that 0.8 to 3.3 billion tons of hatchery wastes are generated every year, using an hatchability value of 50-80% (Al-Harthi et al., 2010), and an average egg weight of 60 g.`,
      `The hatchery industry keeps growing and concentrating, following the demand for poultry products. The larger quantities of hatchery wastes cause increasing environmental problems (see Environmental impact). The traditional methods for disposing of these products are landfill, land application, composting for fertilizer production and rendering. Those methods are expensive (landfill disposal is one of the cheapest methods and its cost was estimated at 13£/t in 2002 in the UK (Gittins et al., 2002)) and was not always practical. While large hatcheries may produce enough waste to supply full truckloads to rendering plants, smaller hatcheries need other means of disposal and may encounter some resistance from authorities and landfill operators (El Boushy et al., 2000). An additional problem is that those wastes have a high moisture content and spoil extremely rapidly, and, therefore, must be processed rapidly into a dried and/or stable form (Deshmukh et al., 1997a). The methods for handling and processing of hatchery wastes have been extensively reviewed by Glatz et al., 2011, who conclude that finding practical techniques for recycling the nutrients in hatchery waste has become a high priority.`,

    Rapeseed meal, called canola meal in North America, Australia and some other countries, is the by-product of the extraction of oil from rapeseed (Brassica napus L., Brassica rapa L. and Brassica juncea L., and their crosses). It is a protein-rich ingredient that is widely used to feed all classes of livestock. Worldwide production of rapeseed meal is second only to soybean meal (USDA, 2016). Rapeseed oil used to have a poor reputation due to the presence of erucic acid, which has a bitter taste and was later found to cause health problems. The use of rapeseed meal as an animal feed was also limited by the presence of glucosinolates, which are antinutritional factors detrimental to animal performance. In the 1960-1970s, low-erucic varieties ("0") and low-erucic, low-glucosinolate varieties ("00", double-zero, double low, canola) were developed, allowing rapeseed oil to become a major food oil, and rapeseed meal and rapeseeds to grow in importance as fed to livestock. The first 00 varieties were introduced commercially in Canada in the mid-1970s. In some countries, such as France, 00 varieties became commercially available in the late 1980s (Doré et al., 2006). Low-erucic, low-glucosinolate varieties are now the main types grown worldwide for edible oil, biofuel, industrial oil and lubricants. There are also high-erucic varieties grown for specific industrial purposes (FAO, 2014; Snowdon, 2006). While solvent-extracted rapeseed meal remains the main type of rapeseed meal commercially available, oil-rich rapeseed meals obtained by mechanical pressure have gained popularity since the turn of the century with the development of organic farming and on-farm oil production.`,

      `Rapeseed meal is often included in the diets of several species of livestock because of its high protein content (35-44% of DM). It is often fed as a substitute for soybean meal. Rapeseed protein is poorer in lysine than soybean (5.5% vs. 6.3% of the crude protein) but is richer in sulphur-containing amino acids (sum of methionine + cysteine: 4.3% vs. 3% of the crude protein). Rapeseeds are small and contain about 18-21% hulls, and the oil meal contains about 30% hulls (Mejicanos et al., 2016; Carré et al., 2016). Thus rapeseed meal has a relatively high fibre content, crude fibre being between 10-18% of DM, which is higher than the crude fibre content of all types of soybean meals, but lower than that of other oil meals such as sunflower meal. Its lignin content is also high (about 10% of DM), whereas the lignin content of soybean meal is usually lower than 1%. The low lysine and high fibre content tends to limit the use of rapeseed meal in monogastric and fish species (Bell, 1993; Royer et al., 2011; Newkirk, 2009). Feeding pigs and poultry with rapeseed meal as their only source of supplementary protein often results in lower animal performance (Fan et al., 1996). Solvent-extracted rapeseed meal contains small amounts of residual oil (about 3% DM). Canadian solvent-extracted canola meal may have a higher oil content due to the reintroduction of gums and soapstocks into the meal during processing (Newkirk, 2009). `,
      `Rapeseed oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (60% C18:1 oleic acid, 21% C18:2 linoleic acid and 10% C18:3 linolenic acid), which makes it valuable for human and animal diets (Blair, 2011). In Australia, a comparison of the fatty acid profile of the residual oil expeller and solvent-extracted meals showed significant differences between them: solvent-extracted meal tended to have a lower proportion of oleic acid than expeller meal (54 vs. 59%) and a higher proportion of linoleic acid (25 vs. 22%) (Spragg et al., 2007). The following table shows the differences between Canadian canola meal and French 00 rapeseed meal for 2011-2013 and 2014, respectively.`,

Glucosinolates also interfere with iodine metabolism. In monogastrics, they cause physiological disorders in the liver, kidneys, and thyroid glands, and, as a consequence, reduce growth and performance.

With pigs it was found that dark hulled seeds were nearly indigestible whereas yellow hulled seeds were reasonably well digested. This was attributed to a lower tannin and lignin content in the brighter seeds (Bell et al., 1982). Lighter varieties of rapeseeds were reported to contain less tannins ("000" varieties) (Auger et al., 2010). Some breeding programmes aim at reducing the thickness of the seed coat, and thus the level of tannins (Lipsa et al., 2012).

Trimethylamine is then converted by an enzyme into an odourless form later excreted through urine. Hens with brown-shelled eggs lack that enzyme and, in these breeds, trimethylamine accumulates in the egg, causing them to have a fishy taste (Newkirk, 2009; Bell, 1993). The amount of rapeseeds should thus be limited for this category of layers (Pickard, 2005). All sources of choline (choline chloride and sinapine from canola meal) can be transformed in trimethylamine, but the tainting effect of rapeseed meal seemed to override the one with choline chloride (Wang et al., 2013; Ward et al., 2009).

This concern led to the development of low-erucic cultivars ("0") in the 1970s, and by 2005 most rapeseed oil produced worldwide contained less than 2% of erucic acid (Snowdon, 2006; Przybylski et al., 2005). The content in erucic acid of foods is now regulated: in Canada, canola oil must contain less than 2% erucic acid (CCC, 2014); in the EU the fat content of foodstuffs must contain less than 5% erucic acid (less than 1% for infant formulae) (EFSA, 2016).`,

      `Sunflower meal is the by-product of the extraction of oil from sunflower seeds. In terms of production, it is the 4th most important oil meal after soybean meal, rapeseed meal and cottonseed meal (Oil World, 2011). A wide variety of products are available on the market, from low-quality straw-like meals to high-quality flours. Sunflower meals can be made from whole or decorticated seeds, and can be mechanically and/or solvent-extracted. The quality of sunflower meal depends on the plant characteristics (seed composition, hulls/kernel ratio, dehulling potential, growth and storage conditions) and on the processing (dehulling, mechanical and/or solvent extraction) (Golob et al., 2002; NRC, 1973). While solvent-extracted sunflower meal remains the main type of sunflower meal commercially available, oil-rich sunflower meals obtained by mechanical pressure only have become more popular since the 2000s, with the development of organic farming and on-farm oil production.`,

      `Sunflower meal is one of the major protein meals used for livestock feeding, particularly for ruminants. It is generally a valuable and safe product, whose protein, fibre and oil contents are highly variable and driven by variations of the oil extraction process. Its protein content ranges from 23% DM for some non-dehulled, mechanically-extracted meals, to more than 40% for highly decorticated, solvent-extracted meals. However, usual ranges for protein are 29-33% DM for non-dehulled meals and 35-39% DM for dehulled and partially dehulled meals. The fibre content is directly linked to the presence of hulls: crude fibre ranges from 27 to 31% DM for non-dehulled meals and from 20 to 26% for dehulled and partially dehulled sunflower meals. The lignin content is important, in the 9-12% range, even for dehulled meals. Solvent-extracted sunflower meals contain about 2-3% DM of residual oil, but mechanically-extracted meals may contain up to 30% oil depending on the amount of pressing. This oil content gives expeller meals a higher gross energy (22 MJ/kg DM or more vs. 19 MJ/kg DM for solvent-extracted meals), but these meals contain less protein than solvent-extracted ones.`,
      `One particularly interesting trait of sunflower meal is the absence of intrinsic antinutritional factors: unlike other oil meals, including those of soybean, rapeseed or cotton, it does not require heating or special attention before being fed. Its amino acid profile is richer in sulfur-containing amino acids, particularly methionine, than other protein sources, but its lysine content is much lower than that of soybean meal (3.5 vs. 6.1% protein). Sunflower meal is considered to be lysine-deficient for several monogastric species (Poncet et al., 2003; Steen, 1989; Villamide et al., 1998; McNab, 2002). Sunflower meal is also a valuable source of calcium, phosphorus and B vitamins (Grompone, 2005).`,
      `The high fibre and lignin content of sunflower meal tends to reduce nutrient digestibility, and its energy values are lower than those of soybean meal. It is suitable for ruminants and rabbits, but only for pigs and poultry with low energy requirements (animals at maintenance, laying hens) or specific fibre requirements (sows) (CETIOM, 2003). In other monogastrics, such as broilers or growing pigs, the cost-effectiveness of including sunflower meal depends on the quality of the meal and on the availability and price of better sources of protein and lysine. It must be reiterated that sunflower meal is a highly variable ingredient where protein, fibre and fat cover a much larger range than in many common feeds. When formulating diets with sunflower meal, one should always take into account the actual analytical composition of the batch used, rather than table values. It must be noted that, unfortunately, many trials involving sunflower meal fail to mention the processes involved (dehulling and extraction type).`,

      `Cotton seeds are the seeds of the cotton plant. Cotton seeds are ovoid, 3.5-10 mm long. They are densely covered with white or rusty, long and woolly hairs, called the lint, which is the main product used to make cotton textiles, and shorter hairs (linters). Commercially available cotton seeds are usually the by-product of the production of cotton fibre by a cotton gin, which separates the lint from the seeds. Consequently, seed production is dominated by factors determining the production of cotton fiber and the seed is about 15-20% of the value of the cotton crop (O'Brien et al., 2005). Depending on the species and variety, cotton lint has different colours (black, brown or red), and may be long and thin (Gossypium hirsutum, 90% of world production), longer and finer (Gossypium barbadense, also called Egyptian cotton) or shorter and thicker (Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium arboretum) (Ikitoo, 2011; Rossin, 2009).`,
      `Once ginned, the cotton seed remains covered with linters and called whole cottonseed or fuzzy cottonseed. The amount of linters left on the seeds varies from 4 to 8%, except for seeds of Gossypium barbadense varieties, such as the American Pima cotton, which are naturally without linters (NCPA, 2012). Linters are a valuable fibre used for paper, cellulose acetate, viscose, explosives, plastic or photographic film. Fuzzy cotton seeds are subject to a mechanical delinting process that yields linters and naked seeds called delinted cottonseed or black or slick cottonseed (Hoffman, 1998). Cotton seeds intended for sowing generally undergo chemical (sulphuric acid) treatment in order to remove linters but these delinted seeds (sometimes called acid cottonseed) should not be used as feed as they may contain chemicals residues and can have an unpalatable flavour (Smith et al., 1999). `,
      `Fuzzy or delinted cotton seeds may be either fed to livestock or submitted to oil extraction, yielding oil, cottonseed meal and hulls. Cotton seeds contain about 20% of valuable cooking oil. A typical cottonseed crushing operation separates the seed into oil (16%), hulls (26%), meal (45.5%) and linters (8.5%) (O'Brien et al., 2005).`,

However, for monogastric animals, the high fibre content and the presence of gossypol are limiting factors and, since cotton seeds contain more fibre and free gossypol than cottonseed meal, whole cotton seeds are much less used in pigs and poultry diets than cottonseed meal.`,

Inadequate storage conditions tend to increase aflatoxin contamination and it is recommended that cotton seeds are stored at moisture contents lower than 10% (O'Brien et al., 2005). Aflatoxin contamination can be reduced by processing: for example aflatoxin content was reduced by 50% when the cotton seeds were processed by two stages of extrusion at a temperature of 132°C (Buser et al., 2001).",

It exists in a free toxic form and in a bound, non-toxic form (Morgan, 1989). Free gossypol is the more important form in unprocessed cotton seeds. In Gossypium hirsutum seeds, total gossypol concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.15% DM and free gossypol concentrations from 0.05 to 0.7% DM have been reported (OGTR, 2008). Gossypol content depends on species, cultivars, fertilizer rates, growing conditions and insect pressure (Blasi et al., 2002; Randel et al., 1992; Carter et al., 1966). "Glandless" cotton varieties without gossypol have been developed but these varieties are more sensitive to pests, less productive, and have thus been found less economically viable, though investigations are still ongoing (Rodman, 2006; Bourzac, 2006). The free gossypol content of cotton products may depend on processing: heating, for instance, increases gossypol binding and reduces toxicity, whereas fine grinding breaks the gossypol glands, releasing gossypol in the product (EFSA, 2008). Extrusion was shown to reduce free gossypol by 71 to 78% in cotton seeds (Buser et al., 2001).`,

      `Soybean meal is the most important protein source used to feed farm animals. It represents two-thirds of the total world output of protein feedstuffs, including all other major oil meals and fish meal (Oil World, 2015). Its feeding value is unsurpassed by any other plant protein source and it is the standard to which other protein sources are compared (Cromwell, 1999). While it has been an accepted part of livestock and poultry diets in the USA since the mid-1930s (Lewis et al., 2001), soybean feed production took off in the mid-1970s and then accelerated in the early 1990s due to a growing demand from developing countries. The expansion of aquaculture and prohibitions on the feed use of slaughterhouse by-products have also fueled the demand for this high-quality source of protein (Steinfeld et al., 2006).`,
      `Soybean meal is the by-product of the extraction of soybean oil. Several processes exist, resulting in different products. Soybean meal is usually classified for marketing by its crude protein content. High-protein types are obtained from dehulled seeds and contain 47-49% protein and 3% crude fibre (as fed basis). Other types of soybean meal include the hulls or part of the hulls and contain less than 47% protein and more than 6% crude fibre. In solvent-extracted soybean meals, the oil content is typically lower than 2% while it exceeds 3% in mechanically-extracted meals (Cromwell, 2012).`,

      `A highly palatable feedstuff, soybean meal is characterised by a high protein content (from 43 to 53% as fed) and a low crude fibre content (less than 3% for the dehulled soybean meals). It has a very good amino acid balance and contains high amounts of lysine, tryptophane, threonine and isoleucine, which are often lacking in cereal grains. However, the concentration of cystine and methionine are suboptimal for monogastric animals, and methionine supplementation is necessary (McDonald et al., 2002). Amino acid digestibility is also very high (more than 90% for lysine in pigs and poultry) (Sauvant et al., 2004).

`,
      `Soybean meal contains oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose that cannot be digested by monogastric animals, due to the lack of a specific endogenous alpha-galactosidase. Raffinose and stachyose can cause flatulence and diarrhoea that may increase the digesta passage rate, and decrease digestion and absorption of dietary nutrients. In poultry, these oligosaccharides have been shown to decrease nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy, fibre digestion, and transit time (Parsons et al., 2000; Coon et al., 1990; Rackis, 1975 and Reddy, 1984 cited by Zuo et al., 1996). Low-oligosaccharide soybean meals are now available.`,

The addition of 40 g/kg NSP to a commercial broiler diet decreased weight gain, feed efficiency and apparent metabolizable energy (AME) by 28.6, 27.0 and 21.2%, respectively (Choct et al., 1995). The antinutritive effects of NSP in poultry and pigs might be due to their physicochemical properties. In particular, soluble viscous NSP depress the digestibilities of protein, starch and fat (Smits et al., 1996). NSP content of soybean meal is approximately 61 and 103 g/kg (dry matter basis) for soluble NSP and insoluble NSP, respectively (Bach Knudsen, 1997). NSP increase microbial activity (fermentations) and may cause intestinal disorder. A comparison between conventional soybean meal and low-oligosaccharide soybean meals have shown an average difference of 7% in total metabolizable energy (TME), and up to 9.8% when the comparison was done with the lowest-oligosaccharide containing soybean meals, in roosters (Parsons et al., 2000).",

        body: "The lipids associated with fish oil are highly unsaturated and can be oxidized easily, so they need to be properly stabilized and handled. Fish oils that have been oxidized can be toxic to animals and are highly unpalatable. Oxidation potential is high in fish oil, because of its content of highly unsaturated fatty acids. If the oil is not properly stabilized the formation of oxidative products can occur that can become toxic to an animal. These oxidative processes can be accelerated if the oil is exposed to light and air. Feeding of fish oil to animals, especially monogastric animals; can cause softening of fat deposits and off-flavors to develop in the edible tissues, so the care needs to be taken to assure that these problems doesn’t affect acceptability of the final products.",

      `It is well established that the human body needs salt. Otherwise known as Sodium Chloride (NaCl), our bodies need salt to live and function, transmitting nerve pulses, expanding and contracting the heart muscle fibres and maintaining a proper balance of fluid in the body, amongst a whole host of other functions. As you might expect, animals’ bodies are no different in their requirement for salt. Livestock in particular need the correct balance of sodium in their diet to ensure the functioning of the immune system, to spread nutrients across cells and to help buffer acid during ruminal fermentation.`,
      `According to the National Research Council, most livestock need between 0.6% and 0.8% salt in their total diet. Supplementing salt into animal feed is necessary as most plants fail to provide a sufficient amount of sodium and may lack essential chlorine contents. Even the minor under-consumption of these vital minerals can lead to reduced reproduction, growth and milk production – decreasing productivity and profitability often without any noticeable visible signs.`,

      `Palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) is the leading edible oil in terms of global production and export, with Indonesia and Malaysia being the leading producers. Palm oil’s very high yield per hectare necessitates the use of substantially less arable land than any other edible oil. A balanced fatty acid composition (~ 50% saturated and 50% unsaturated fatty acids) makes it a versatile oil for numerous food applications. Various minor components (pro vitamin A and vitamin E) provide additional avenues for its use in human nutrition. This chapter reviews the nutritional attributes of palm oil, primarily from the standpoint of its fatty acid composition.`,
